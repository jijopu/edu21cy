### Learning Physics from scratch

S. Assa Aravindh

When it comes to Science learning, Physics is the most abstract subject which students often struggle to understand the basics. Especially in todayâ€™s mixed major course scenario, where both science and technology students need to understand basic Physics in real-world situations, as it explains the science underlying everything around them. However, the Physics enthusiast often encounters situations, in which a lot of study material is available and hard to choose the best option. Here is a list of three books that every serious student must go through to understand the foundations of modern Physics.

1\. **Concepts of Modern Physics - Arthur Beiser**

_A website where it is freely available for 30 days reading:_ [https://www.scribd.com/document/325364400/Concepts-of-Modern-Physics-Arthur-Beiser-3750](https://www.scribd.com/document/325364400/Concepts-of-Modern-Physics-Arthur-Beiser-3750 "https://www.scribd.com/document/325364400/Concepts-of-Modern-Physics-Arthur-Beiser-3750")

2\. **The Feynman Lectures on Physics**

A compilation of some of the exemplary works of the Nobel laureate, Richard P Feynman. These lectures are first delivered to Caltech

It is available free to download from Caltech online resources: [https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/ "https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/")

3\. **Fundamentals of Physics: by David Halliday, Jearl Walker, and Robert Resnick**

This text book covers most basic aspects of Physics such as Mechanics, Waves, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Optics and Special relativity
