## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Being a young democracy, India has been facing challenges in educating its massive population. The state of Kerala has done extremely well in access and equity. Itâ€™s time we moved to the next level and transformed our education system into a world class one. Such a transformation requires substantial amount of resources in terms of money and expertise. In the wake of the NEP 2020, there are opportunities to bring about such changes and at the same time, there are immense challenges.

We are bringing together a pool of talented and passionate people who are willing to provide their expertise and resources to help the state in this enormous task. To start with we have been creating curated content related to undergraduate curriculum to help teachers and students in online teaching and learning. We welcome you all to join us if you can create similar content. Let us work together to create an education system our young generation truly deserves in 21st Century.
